# Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns playing the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in a browser. The game can be restarted once a winner is determined or if there's a draw.

## Features
- Two-player gameplay (Player X and Player O).
- A responsive 3x3 grid board.
- Display of the current player's turn.
- Winning and draw conditions.
- Restart the game once it finishes.

## How to Play
1. Click on any empty cell on the board to place your mark (either "X" or "O").
2. Players take turns, with Player X starting first.
3. The game ends when one player has 3 of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or when all cells are filled (draw).
4. You can restart the game by clicking the "Restart Game" button.
